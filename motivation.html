        <h1>Motivation</h1>
        <p>On this page you will find my research of what is motivation and how its theory applies to me - how motivated I am.</p>

        <h2>Theory</h2>
        <p>What exaclty is motivation? What types of motivation can be distinguished?</p>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>There are a lot of different and slightly different definitions of motivation. Accoding to Kendra Cherry, motivation is the process that initiates, guides, and maintains goal-oriented behaviors (<a href="#citation-1" class="citation">Kendra Cherry, 2020</a>). In other words, it is the reason why people do things that lead to accomplishing certain goals. A person could spend time watching TV, but instead, he spent it writting a book, why? Because of motivation.</p>
        <h3>Types of motivation</h3>
        <p>People can be motivated to do things because of different reasons. Phychologists distinguish two types of motivation, based on where these reasons come from.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Extrinsic motivation.</strong> When a person is extrinsically motivated, he does the work because it leads him to some sort of result - money, awards, or work result itself. A person might not enjoy what he is doing, but he will do it, for external reasons. (<a href="#citation-2" class="citation">David Burkus, 2020</a>)</li>
            <li><strong>Intrinsic motivation.</strong> That is when person does work because he enjoys doing it. It comes from the inside of a body, not from an external motivating factor. (<a href="#citation-2" class="citation">David Burkus, 2020</a>)</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Dan Pink about motivation</h3>
        <p>Pink talked about differences in people performance if they are extrinsically motivated, or intrinsically motivated.</p>
        <p><strong>Extrinsic</strong> motivation, or the "carrot and stick" approach , is a good, effective and working method to motivate people do <strong>simple and straightforward</strong> tasks, like carry 5 fridges to the 8th floor - if you would get 20 dollars for that you would do it more effectively. </p>
        <p>But this approach <strong>doesn't</strong> work for most of the tasks of 21th century, since they require thinking out-of-the-box. Experiments have shown that extrinsic motivation blocks creativity, which is the only important thing nowadays, because most of non-creative tasks have already been automated. The solution is to make people have intrinsic motivation, so they do things because they like it. (<a href="#citation-3" class="citation">Dan Pink, 2009</a>)</p>
        <h4>My conclusion</h4>
        <p>About applying intrinsic motivation rather than extrinsic, Daniel talked on the level of organizations, companies and business. However, anology can also be driven to a personal level. Since studying and programming is not a straighforward and easy process, it is better to have intrinsic motivation for it.</p>
        
        <h2>Motivation Test</h2>
        <p>I did a test from <a class="page__link" href="https://www.seemypersonality.com/Motivation-Test#q1 ">this link</a> to know more about my motivation. Below are results from this test and my opinion about them.</p>
        <h4>Result report.</h4>
            <p>You sometimes have a strong drive for completing important tasks, but you will often not be driven if you do not feel the task is important enough. You actively seek out activities that will make you happy, including parties, hanging out with family and friends or even thrill seeking through sports etc... You also tend to be fairly impulsive.You are very motivated by seeking reward for your behaviour. The offer of a reward (such as a promotion for working hard or winning a bet) will keep you motivated to complete difficult activities. Your major motivation is to avoid things that you don't like. This can mean organising your life to avoid activities you don't enjoy, or to escape punishment or pain. You can also tend to be a fairly nervous person.</p>
            <h4>My opinion</h4>
            <p>I do agree with the test result. For example, I am truly not driven if I feel that the task is not very important. I knew that I had to practise my talk before giving the pitch for PCO-1, but I didn't, because thought I was already prepared enough. As a result, during my presentation I had a lot of stress, spoke too fast, said a lot of informal and badly-structured sentences; and because of this I got 4/5 score for presentation. I also didn't include everything I wanted to say about myself and my website and got 4/5 for development environment, because I forgot to tell about it. (<a href="#citation-pdf1" class="citation">PCO-1 Feedback</a>)</p>

            <h2>Career anchors/values</h2>
            <p>Below are two career values that are the most important to me, based on the test (<a class="citation" href="#citation-4">Work Values Test</a>) and my thoughts:</p>
            <h3>1. Self-development</h3>
            <p>We live only once, why spend this life as a small ant in a big world who doesn't know anything? I am truly intrinsicly motivated to study the things that I feel are important. I liked physics - I used to study it 24/7. I like programming - I do it, because I like it.</p>
            <h3>2. Performance</h3>
            <p>Even a strong intrinsic motivation needs some extrinsic fuel. If my performace in not valued by others, it will <em>'drive me into the red area of a traffic light'</em></p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>I think that I do have intrinsic motivation for things related to programming and self-development. However, I also need a little of an extrinsic part to my motivation, I feel that this is what can help me when I am heading to the yellow light.</p>
            <h2>Feedback</h2>
            <p>I believe that Iosif is indeed is intrinsically motivated, meaning that he does something as long as he sees the point of doing so. However, he has a little need of an extrinsic motivation. It is important for him to get an satisfactory result from his doings, so he can be proud of what he has done.</p>

        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
        <p>My name is <strong>Iosif Zhytnikau</strong> and I am first-year ICT-HBO student at HZ University.</p>
        <p>Below you will find why I chose ICT-HBO programme</p>
        <p>If you want to know more about me, <br>then <a class="page__link" href="/profile.html">jump to the Profile page</a></p>

        <p class="page__image-name">Me 1.1</p>
        <h2>What is this website ?</h2>
        <p>This is my Portfolio website. I've done it as an assignment for HZ University. As this is my first website (I had experience with HTML and PHP but it was not about creating websites), so, as this is my first website, don't expect it to be perfect, but I think it's quite nice.</p>
        <h2>Why did I choose ICT, and, specifically, ICT-HBO?</h2>
        <p>Programming has been my hobby since I was 14 years old; and, in order to learn how to program, I did not go to any facilities, but did a lot of self-studying.</p>
        <p>I watched YouTube lessons, read books, articles, and documentations.</p>
        <p>And I found out that nowadays any theoretical material can be found easily, unaided.</p>
        <p>Therefore, I used to think that there was no need to study at a university to be a successful programmer.</p>
        <p>But there are a lot of essential skills that cannot be acquired at home, skills concerning practice, team-working, communication and more.<br> What is the point of knowing things when I cannot efficiently apply them?</p>
        <p>What I like about HZ is that it is based on applying knowledge.<br> And with a complement of my willing to self-study it is a place to fully realize my potential.</p>
